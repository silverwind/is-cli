> Detect if the current script was ran as a CLI

Returns `true` if the current module was ran directly by `node` and not imported by another module. This is useful for CLI-style modules that also export values.

## Usage

```bash
npm i is-cli
```

```js
const isCLI = require("is-cli")(module);
// => true
```
